# WoT Relay

WOT Relay is a Nostr relay that saves all the notes that people you follow, and people they follow are posting. It's built on the [Khatru](https://khatru.nostr.technology) framework.

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **Build Essentials**: If you're using Linux, you may need to install build essentials. You can do this by running `sudo apt install build-essential`.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the WOT Relay running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitvora/wot-relay.git
cd wot-relay
```

### 2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

You'll need to create an `.env` file based on the example provided in the repository.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Set your environment variables

Open the `.env` file and set the necessary environment variables. Example variables include:

```bash
OWNER_PUBKEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...xxx" # your pubkey, in hex format
RELAY_NAME="YourRelayName"
RELAY_PUBKEY="YourPublicKey" # the relay pubkey, in hex format
RELAY_DESCRIPTION="Your relay description"
DB_PATH="/home/ubuntu/wot-relay/db" # any path you would like the database to be saved.
INDEX_PATH="/home/ubuntu/wot-relay/templates/index.html" # path to the index.html file
STATIC_PATH="/home/ubuntu/wot-relay/templates/static" # path to the static folder
REFRESH_INTERVAL_HOURS=24 # interval in hours to refresh the web of trust
MINIMUM_FOLLOWERS=3 #how many followers before they're allowed in the WoT
ARCHIVAL_SYNC="FALSE" # set to TRUE to archive every note from every person in the WoT (not recommended)
```

### 4. Build the project

Run the following command to build the relay:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=$(git describe --tags --always)"
```

### 5. Create a Systemd Service (optional)

To have the relay run as a service, create a systemd unit file. Here's an example:

1. Create the file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wot-relay.service
```

2. Add the following contents:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=WOT Relay Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/wot-relay/wot-relay #change this to your path
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/wot-relay #change this to your path
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace `/path/to/` with the actual paths where you cloned the repository and stored the `.env` file.

3. Reload systemd to recognize the new service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. Start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start wot-relay
```

5. (Optional) Enable the service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable wot-relay
```

#### Permission Issues on Some Systems

the relay may not have permissions to read and write to the database. To fix this, you can change the permissions of the database folder:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 /path/to/db
```

### 6. Serving over nginx (optional)

You can serve the relay over nginx by adding the following configuration to your nginx configuration file:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3334;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.

After adding the configuration, restart nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 7. Install Certbot (optional)

If you want to serve the relay over HTTPS, you can use Certbot to generate an SSL certificate.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

After installing Certbot, run the following command to generate an SSL certificate:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Follow the instructions to generate the certificate.

### 8. Access the relay

Once everything is set up, the relay will be running on `localhost:3334` or your domain name if you set up nginx.

## Start the Project with Docker Compose

To start the project using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure the `.env` file is present in the project directory and has the necessary environment variables set.
4. You can also change the paths of the `db` folder and `templates` folder in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - "./db:/app/db" # only change the left side before the colon
     - "./templates/index.html:/app/templates/index.html" # only change the left side before the colon
     - "./templates/static:/app/templates/static" # only change the left side before the colon
   ```

5. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   # in foreground
   docker compose up --build
   # in background
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

6. For updating the relay, run the following command:

   ```sh
   git pull
   docker compose build --no-cache
   # in foreground
   docker compose up
   # in background
   docker compose up -d
   ```

This will build the Docker image and start the `wot-relay` service as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The application will be accessible on port 3334.

### 7. Hidden Service with Tor (optional)

Same as the step 6, but with the following command:

```sh
# in foreground
docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up --build
# in background
docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up --build -d
```

You can find the onion address here: `tor/data/relay/hostname`

### 8. Access the relay

Once everything is set up, the relay will be running on `localhost:3334`.

```bash
http://localhost:3334
```
